# Portfolio2020

Hiroki Kobayashi's design portfolio in 2020. Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository!

**This website is under construction.**

## Overview
* This is Nuxt.js project with the Typescript support.
* The use of Typescript is based on vue-property-decorator.
* This project does not need nuxt-based complicated functions such as asyncData, so all .vue file should have ``export default class ComponentName extends Vue {}``, not ``Vue.extend({})``, with the import of Vue from vue-property-decorator.
  * Please note that I do not use nuxt-property-decorator.

## Development Build Setup

In this project we use ``yarn`` instead of ``npm``.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev
```
## Design
Design layout outputs such as AdobeXD file is not provided. All designs are coding-based.
